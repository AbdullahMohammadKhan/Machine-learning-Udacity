## Natural Language Processing to classify text SMS

### Objective:
This project aims at implementing method for SPAM-filtering in Python, on a dataset containing SMS data.This project uses Python 2.7.11 and iPython Notebooks.

It uses a dataset of 5,572 labelled SMS, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes model for classification. It is developed in the file Notebook.ipynb

Code of this project can be found in "NLP for SMS Classification.ipynb".

An overall accuracy of around 99% has been reached.

### Required Software:

We will need scikit-learn and pandas (and their dependencies) already installed. Installing the Anaconda distribution of Python is an easy way to accomplish this.

The coding part has been done using the IPython/Jupyter notebook, and all the necessary modules needed for this project is available there.

### Detailed Outline:

Reading a text-based dataset into pandas
Representing text as numerical data
Vectorizing our dataset
Model building in scikit-learn
Evaluating a model
Comparing models
